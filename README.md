# The characteristics of the Korean NFT market and strategies for target expansion
## Overview

This repository is for the research on the specialty of the Korean NFT market in comparison to the global and American NFT market, and suggests the solution for expanding the targets. The Input folder includes the datasets manipulated in the paper and a bibTex file used for a bibliography in RMarkdown file. The output folder consists of RMarkdown file with the exported pdf file, and the log file. Finally, RScript cleaning the input datasets is included in Script folder.

## Comupational Requirements

To run the codes in RMarkdown and RScript file, R[1] is required to be installed. Related R packages should be installed before running the codes as well, and it is acheivable by running codes in 'computational_requirements.R' file in this repository. We used tidyverse[2] to manipulate the datasets, knitr[3] and kableExtra[4] to generate tables with the cleaned datasets and fix its placement in the paper. usmap[5] helped to plot datasets on US map, generating related figures. Finally, bookdown[6] was used as a powerful cross referene tool for generating final pdf document.
